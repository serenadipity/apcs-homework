Code Review

https://github.com/Melisssssssssa/APCSFinalProj.git


Capture_pde.pde:

- Lines 16-19 --> A little bit confused how this code works. Maybe add comments to clarify?

- Lines 35-36 --> I think there's a method open() that you could use to call the saved image?

- Line 39 --> You should put some text in your processing window telling the user what 'a' does

- LInes 41-46 --> Confused what the function of the random number is?



pleasework3_pde:

- Line 2 --> What exactly does ycam represent? Just a bit unclear (maybe add a comment)

- Lines 38-42 --> Maybe rename variable x? Not sure what it represents


Overall:

- Seems pretty straightforward and clear

- Just add a few more comments and rename a few variables to make the code even more clear

- Maybe try organizing the overall structure in a way that is more clear to read (show a progression more
	clearly, similar to methods and a driver in regular java files)
