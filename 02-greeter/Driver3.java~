	 1. Type in the greeter and driver and test them
	 2. Uncomment the line specified in greeter, run - what happens and why
	    then comment the line again
	 3. See if you can figure out how to change the instance variable
	 4. Run again - are g1 and g2 greeterin you differently now?
	    Why or why not?
	 5. What if we make the instance variable greeting provate.
	    Does it change what you did for questions 3 and 4?
